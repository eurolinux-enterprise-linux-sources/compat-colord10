Version 0.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Released: 2011-01-13

Notes:
 - Colord is a simple system activated daemon that maps devices to color
   profiles.
 - It is used by gnome-color-manager for CUPS integration and is also
   used when there are no users logged in.
 - The only real user at the moment is CUPS, but GNOME Color Manager
   will start depending on colord when it is included in most mainstream
   distributions.
 - The DBus interface is not set in stone, and the libcolord library
   will have new API added to it as required. If colord needs to break
   public API at this stage for a specific use case, it will.
 - The persistent storage code is not written yet, but that will come
   with the next colord version.

New Features:
 - Add a 'Kind' attribute to the device objects (Richard Hughes)
 - Add a libcolord shared library that can be used in the client tools (Richard Hughes)
